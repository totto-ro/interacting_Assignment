# Interacting

Objectives:

Add complexity to the game by adding a method to the location objects we created.

Invoke the method whenever the player visits that location object.

Now that a player is able to walk around our map of the Hundred Acre Wood, let's make the game a little more interesting by giving the characters in the homes a chance to speak. We can add methods to an object by creating an attribute that has an anonymous function for a value. The function can be anonymous, or without a name, because it will use the key as a name.
